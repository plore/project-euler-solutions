# The answer is the least common multiple of all numbers from 1 to 20
# Factoring all numbers into their primes we get
# 1: 1
# 2: 2
# 3: 3
# 4: 2, 2
# 5: 5
# 6: 2, 3
# 7: 7
# 8: 2, 2, 2
# 9: 3, 3
# 10: 2, 5
# 11: 11
# 12: 2, 2, 3
# 13: 13
# 14: 2, 7
# 15: 3, 5
# 16: 2, 2, 2, 2
# 17: 17
# 18: 2, 3, 3
# 19: 19
# 20: 2, 2, 5

# The superset of all those sets of primes is {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}
